# CitySimilarityTool
A tool that compares the climates of cities across the world, written in Python. This was part of my undergraduate university dissertation. Download the .zip file and extract it, then run CitySimilarityTool.exe.

In the code section there is a file called code.zip that can be downloaded to access the code.

The .csv files in the CitySimilarityTool.zip can be edited to add additional data.
